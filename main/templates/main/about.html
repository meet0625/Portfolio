  <h1>About Me 🧠</h1>

  <p>
    I am an Information Technology student with a strong interest in building
    practical, reliable, and scalable software solutions. I enjoy working across
    both backend and frontend technologies, with a particular focus on Python
    and Django for backend development.
  </p>

  <p>
    My approach to development is simple: understand the problem clearly,
    design a structured solution, and write clean, maintainable code. I believe
    that good software should not only work correctly but also be easy to
    understand, extend, and maintain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside technical skills, I value consistency, problem-solving, and
    continuous learning. I regularly work on personal projects to strengthen
    my understanding of real-world development practices and to explore new
    tools and technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portfolio represents my journey as a developer — showcasing my skills,
    projects, and the mindset I bring to every piece of work I build.
