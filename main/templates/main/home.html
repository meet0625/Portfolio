  <h1>Hey there! I’m an IT Developer 👋</h1>

  <p class="subtitle">
    I build smart, scalable, and creative digital solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m an Information Technology student who loves turning ideas into working
    applications. From backend logic in Django to clean and responsive
    interfaces, I enjoy building systems that are efficient, reliable,
    and pleasant to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe good software should be both powerful and simple. That’s why I
    focus on clean code, structured architecture, and continuous learning —
    all while keeping creativity alive.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight-line">
    Code with logic. Design with creativity. Deliver with confidence.
